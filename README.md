This is a Game Development project I made to advance the skills I learned prior to and during the development of my PongGame. I had just learned about Graphical User Interfaces and Java Swing, and we did a guided ball drop game, which I carried forward into the Pong Game. The Space Invaders game goes beyond that, to bring you a shooter game, with a spaceship and aliens moving in unison. To get the game up and running, you can download all these files and run the RunMe.bat file.
